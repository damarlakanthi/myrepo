          <h1>About Me</h1> 
          <p>Hi. i'm Kanthi you can also call me a product designer, interaction, UI, UX or by any other market defined title.</p>
          <p>I don't like to define myself by the work I've done. I define myself by the work I'm going to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning continuously and challenge myself to do intresting things
  
          </p>
          <p>I'm never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.</p>
          <p>I value simple content structure, clean design patterns, and thoughtful interactions.</p>
          <p>I genuinely care about people, and love helping fellow designers work on their craft.</p>
          <p>I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.
  
          </p>
          <p>I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course of my life and career.
